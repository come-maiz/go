summary: the go programming language.
description: |
  Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple,
  reliable, and efficient software.
  .
  This snapcraft part allows to build programs written in go.
  .
  Usage:
    Add "after: [go]" to your part written in go. This will use the latest go
    from the master branch to compile your program.
    .
    If you want to specify a go version, also add a go part with the version as
    the source-tag value. For example, to use go 1.7.5, use:
      parts:
        my-go-program:
          ...
          after: [go]
        go:
          source-tag: go1.7.5
confinement: strict

parts:
  go:
    plugin: nil
    build-packages: [golang-go, g++]
    source: https://go.googlesource.com/go
    source-type: git
    override-build: |
      cd src && env GOROOT_BOOTSTRAP=$(go env GOROOT | tr -d '\n') ./make.bash
      cd ..
      cp -R bin $SNAPCRAFT_PART_INSTALL
    stage:
      - 'bin'
    prime:
      - '-*'
